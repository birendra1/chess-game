*   Node.js (version 14 or higher)
*   A web browser (such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox)
*   A text editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text)

### How to Run the Project

4.  Run the command `npm run start` to start the server.
5.  Open a web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3005> to play the game.

### Gameplay

The game is a basic implementation of chess, with the following features:

*   A 8x8 grid board
*   Six types of pieces: king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn
*   Basic move rules for each piece type
*   Check and checkmate detection
*   Ability to undo and redo moves

### Future Development

This is a basic implementation of a chess game, and there are many features that could be added to make the game more robust and enjoyable. Some ideas for future development include:

*   Implementing advanced move rules, such as castling and en passant
*   Adding a timer or clock to limit the amount of time players have to make their moves
*   Creating a scoreboard or ranking system to track players' progress
*   Implementing AI opponents or online multiplayer capabilities

I hope you enjoy playing the game! Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for future development.
